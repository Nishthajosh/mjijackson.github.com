Since writing about [Ruby configuration objects][config] a few months ago, I've
done a bit of hacking on my original `Config` class. My main issue with it is
that it's basically serving as a wrapper for a Hash, but it's a foreign
interface. In other words, if you hand a Config object to another developer,
he's going to have to look up the API before he can use it. But that defeats
the purpose for writing it in the first place.

The whole idea was to be as flexible as possible, so that configuration objects
would be instantly usable and familiar. I don't want anyone (including myself)
to have to think about using the object. It should be easy to use and follow
the [principle of least surprise][surprise] as closely as possible.

Also, configuration objects should have powerful methods that allow users to
iterate over them, inspect them easily, and merge and compare them with other
objects. Obviously [Hash][hash] provides lots of built-in methods for doing
this sort of thing, but it's not as flexible as I'd like it to be.

The solution? [SymbolTable][symtable].

SymbolTable is a much more generalized version of my original Config object
that actually subclasses [Hash][hash]. With all of the nice methods of Hash
already built-in, a SymbolTable object becomes much more powerful than its
Config predecessor and immediately usable.

    require 'symboltable'

    t = SymbolTable.new

    # Lots of convenient accessor methods
    t[:a] = 1
    t[:a]       # => 1
    t['a']      # => 1
    t.a         # => 1
    t.a = 5
    t[:a]       # => 5

    # Functions just like a Hash
    t.sort.each do |key, value|
      puts "Key #{key} has value #{value}"
    end

    # You can even merge with another SymbolTable
    b = SymbolTable.new
    b[:b] = 'hi'
    t.merge!(b)

Configuration objects are just one excellent use case for such an object. To
install the code, use [RubyGems][rubygems].

    $ sudo gem install symboltable
