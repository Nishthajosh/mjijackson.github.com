A few weeks ago, I was looking for a [Lightbox][lb]-like script that would allow me to display more than just pictures. In addition to static images, my client required the ability to display various types of movies including [QuickTime][qt] and [SWF][swf]. The only script that fit the bill was [Lightwindow][lw] -- a nice piece of work to be sure -- but it required the [Prototype][pr] + [Scriptaculous][sc] combo and I was already using [YUI][yui].

[qt]: http://www.apple.com/quicktime/
[swf]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF
[lw]: http://www.stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/
[pr]: http://www.prototypejs.org
[sc]: http://script.aculo.us
[yui]: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/

Besides, I thought, it would be really great to have a full-featured media viewing application that was [library agnostic][ag]. Then, if I need to use a different framework for some particular reason, I can easily switch.

Thus was born [Shadowbox][sb] -- a cross-browser, cross-platform, cleanly-coded and fully-documented media viewer application built entirely in JavaScript. More information is [here][sb].
