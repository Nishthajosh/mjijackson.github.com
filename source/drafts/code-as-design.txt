I'll admit it: I'm obsessed with creating beautiful code.

As a software architect and developer, I probably read through several hundred lines of code every day, much of which is my own creation. However, on occasion, just like any other developer, I have been asked to take over or tweak some code that was developed by someone else.

Few emotions are more nauseating than the thought that for the next several hours (or days) I will be reading through hundreds of lines of incomprehensible spaghetti code in an attempt to understand the original author's methods and/or intent. That's why when I write code I take the time to make sure that every method is documented and every non-trivial piece of logic is explained, either through explicit comments or self-documenting means.
