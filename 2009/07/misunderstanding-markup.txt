Jeremy Keith in response to the comments on [Zeldman's XHTML DOA WTF][wtf]:

> The death of XHTML 2 does not mean the death of XHTML syntax. If you want to
> continue to close all tags and quote all attributes, you can do so. You can
> either use the existing XHTML 1 spec or you can use HTML 5.

As a [few][willison] [have][gruber] [pointed][defreyne] [out][zeldman], there is quite a bit of misunderstanding out there regarding XHTML 2 and HTML 5. This is an excellent article for anyone confused about the relationship between XHTML 1, XHTML 2, HTML 4 and HTML 5.
