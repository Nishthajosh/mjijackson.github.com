title: About
---

Hi, I'm Michael Jackson (yes, the *real* Michael Jackson.) I'm a California
native currently living in the beautiful state of Utah. I've been designing and
developing web sites since I was a kid, and have worked professionally in the
field since 2004. I keep my [code on GitHub][github] and my [random thoughts on
Twitter][twitter].

I am passionate about clean, modern design and code. When it comes to the web,
I believe that [standards](http://www.webstandards.org/) are a good thing and
that everyone wins when businesses and developers adhere to them. Instead of
striving for backwards compatibility with antiquated browsers such as the
[infamous Internet Explorer][ie], I chose to live in the present and target
more modern, standards-compliant web browsers when I write code. My basic
philosophy is this: people who use better browsers deserve a better experience.

This site is my own personal collection of links and commentary. Most of the
time I use it as a sort of bookmarking system because just about everything I
post here is something that I find interesting and would probably read again.
However, I do post original content here as well. Everything is written in
[Markdown][markdown], published with [Rake][rake], and served using
[HTML5][html5] on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] platform. Feel free to check out
the [source][src] if you'd like.

I hope you enjoy your visit to my little corner of the web. If you would like to
get in touch, please feel free to contact me at
