title: About
---

Hi, I'm Michael Jackson (yes, the *real* Michael Jackson.) I'm a California
native currently residing in the beautiful state of Utah. I've been designing
and developing web sites since I was a kid, and have worked professionally in
the field since 2004. I currently keep my [code on GitHub][github], my [random
thoughts on Twitter][twitter], and my [bookmarks on Delicious][delicious].

I am passionate about clean, modern design and code. When it comes to the web,
I believe that [standards](http://www.webstandards.org/) are a good thing and
that both businesses and individuals are greatly benefitted by adherence to
them. Instead of striving for backwards compatibility with antiquated browsers
such as the [infamous Internet Explorer][ie], I chose to live in the present
and target more modern, standards-compliant web browsers. My basic philosophy
is this: people who use better browsers deserve a better experience.

This site is my own personal collection of links and commentary. Most of the
time, I'm using this site as a sort of bookmarking system because just about
everything here is something that I find interesting and would probably read
again, but I do post original content here as well. All content is written using
John Gruber's excellent [Markdown][markdown] tool for web writers and published
using a combination of [Rake][rake] and [Nginx][nginx].

I use the [HTML 5][html5] [doctype][doctype] on this site and it should
[validate][w3c] as such.

I hope you enjoy your visit to my little corner of the web. If you would like to
