Hi, I'm Michael Jackson (yes, the *real* Michael Jackson.) I'm a California native currently residing in the beautiful state of Utah. I've been designing and developing web sites since I was a kid, and have worked professionally in the field since 2004. I currently keep my [code on GitHub](http://github.com/mjijackson), my [random thoughts on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mjijackson), and my [bookmarks on Delicious](http://delicious.com/mjijackson).

I am passionate about clean, modern design and code. When it comes to the web, I believe that [standards](http://www.webstandards.org/) are a good thing and that both businesses and individuals are greatly benefitted by adherence to them. Instead of striving for backwards compatibility with antiquated browsers such as the [infamous Internet Explorer](http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer.html), I chose to live in the present and target more modern, standards-compliant web browsers. My basic philosophy is this: people who use better browsers deserve a better experience.

This site is my own personal collection of links and commentary. Most of the time, I'm using this site as a sort of bookmarking system because just about everything here is something that I find interesting and would probably read again, but I do post original content here as well. All content is written using [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net)'s excellent [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) tool for web writers and published using a combination of [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) and [Nginx](http://nginx.org/).

I use the [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) [doctype](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#the-doctype) on this site and it should [validate](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fmjijackson.com%2F) as such. I host this site on a VPS at [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com/). After using several other comparable hosting services, I am happy to have finally found one that I actually enjoy using. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for fast, clean, and simple tools for managing their web sites and services.
