Hans Kullin:

> So instead of doing the right thing and using the input from readers to improve a poor article, TechCrunch choses to leave incorrect statements up on their site. Instead of subscribing to Dan Gillmor's view that "my readers know more than I do", TechCrunch apparently thinks that their readers are idiots (and that Swedes can't read).

Incidents like this one definitely make me pause and think before linking to anything from [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/). (Via [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=736460).)
