Jakob Nielsen:

> Most websites (and many other applications) mask passwords as
> users type them, and thereby theoretically prevent miscreants
> from looking over users' shoulders. Of course, a truly skilled
> criminal can simply look at the keyboard and note which keys
> are being pressed. So, password masking doesn't even protect
> fully against snoopers.

> More importantly, there's usually nobody looking over your
> shoulder when you log in to a website. It's just you, sitting
> all alone in your office, suffering reduced usability to protect
> against a non-issue.

I love how he calls it a "non-issue" ... he's absolutely right. (Via [John Gruber][jg].)
