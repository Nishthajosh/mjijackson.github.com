My most sincere apologies for the duplicate items that have been showing up in your feed reader. Until my last post, I was neglecting to include a proper [Atom ID](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id) in my feed, so when I would make any small change to the feed format some readers would assume that every article was new.

It's all been fixed now so this shouldn't happen any more in the future. Thanks for your patience!
