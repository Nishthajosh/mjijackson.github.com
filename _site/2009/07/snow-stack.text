Charles Ying introduces "A new 3D CSS Visual Effects demo using pure HTML, WebKitâ€™s 3D CSS Effects extensions and JavaScript."

Absolutely stunning work. This makes me wonder why I should even attempt to use any other platform for web application development when WebKit on Snow Leopard is obviously the most advanced web platform out there.
