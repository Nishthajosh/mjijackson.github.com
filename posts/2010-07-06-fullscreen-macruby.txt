While researching a way to create fullscreen apps in Cocoa, I came across [an
article][cwl] by Matt Gallagher written about a year ago that described the
process in detail. I've been experimenting a lot lately with [MacRuby][macruby],
Apple's Ruby implementation built on top of Objective-C and [LLVM][llvm], and I
decided to port Matt's code to use Ruby instead of Objective-C.

The result is [Fullscreen][fs], a small sample app that demonstrates how to
create a fullscreen window in MacRuby. To run the app, you need to have the
latest MacRuby (0.6) installed.

Enjoy!
