This morning, I released version 1.0 of [Shadowbox][sb]. In its first month, the beta was downloaded over 15,000 times! I really appreciate the amount of interest the JavaScript community has shown in this project. I'm working hard to make sure that it's a quality piece of code, and I hope you enjoy it. The 1.0 version includes the following feature enhancements over the previous betas:

- Extensive and fully documented JavaScript API
- Compatibility with the original [Lightbox][lb] HTML markup
- Support for image maps
- Numerous other options and bug fixes

If you have any questions about how to use Shadowbox for your project, please ask them in the [support forum][forum].
