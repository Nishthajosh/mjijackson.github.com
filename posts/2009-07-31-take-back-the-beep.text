Please keep ranting David! I have expressed my frustration countless times to those who know me on this very issue. It's absurd that I'm still listening to such instructional messages every time I call someone in 2009. This is a very good example of the telecommunications companies following one another around like sheep instead of thinking for themselves.

All it takes is one person to stand up in a meeting and say, "Why in the world do we still have those silly messages whenever someone calls one of our customers?" (Via [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/30/pogue-beep).)
